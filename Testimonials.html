            <td>Your courses are one of the best practical trainings out there. I have seen Vivek presenting live in a conference, and I like his way of sharing knowledge. It is clean, understandable, and explains the necessary background information without me having to dig into a topic for hours to understand what’s going on. Usually I am having hard time when looking for online, self-paced and on-demand trainings, which are technical without having to read again and again the high level concepts. Securitytube satisfies all my requirements for a technical training and it is very affordable! Best quality/price combo. Training material is well structured, practices after each section are great to help understanding the topic, exams are also great practical ones. You actually need to think and learn a bit to pass the exam, however the training covers enough details to pass them without much additional research. There are no pre-defined questions or answers.</td></tr>

    <td>The JavaScript for Pentesters course is not just about learning JavaScript programming language and Cross Site Scripting (XSS).  Its also about how to take advantage of XSS vulnerability to build advanced attacks such as Stealing user information, Logging Keystrokes and DOM manipulation. This course is very helpful to my daily work and I really enjoyed the course. I will continue to take Vivek’s other courses and I highly recommend this course to my friends and colleagues.</td></tr>

        <td>SecurityTube and Vivek Ramachandran are making a significant contribution and impact in the field of Information Security Education. My experience completing Wireless Security Expert has been fun and highly satisfying. The course content is of high-quality, hands-on & crystal-clear to understand. Vivek has the unique gift of transferring his knowledge seemingly casually yet very effectively. The technique of breaking topics into delicious small-chunks make them easy to absorb irrespective of the complexity of the subject. After passing the SWSE, I am having fun doing the Python Scripting Expert course!</td></tr>
